## README Legal Notice

# Proprietary Repository Notice (No License)

**Owner:** Birds Hill Burdock (“BHB”)
**Effective date:** 2026-01-02
**Repository purpose:** Website source, product images, product copy, brand assets, and related materials.

## 1) Ownership status

All original content in this repository is **proprietary** and **copyright-protected** upon creation in fixed form under Canadian law, unless explicitly marked otherwise. ([ISED][1])

## 2) Copyright

**Copyright © 2026 Birds Hill Burdock. All rights reserved.**

Copyright protects the **expression** embodied in these materials (text, photos, graphics, code, layout, and other original creative output), not the underlying ideas or concepts. ([ISED][2])

## 3) No license granted

**No license is granted** to use, copy, modify, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell, or create derivative works from any part of this repository, except as required by law or as expressly permitted in writing by BHB.

## 4) GitHub platform carveout (public repo reality)

This repository is public. By GitHub’s Terms, other GitHub users may **view** and **fork** public repositories using GitHub’s functionality. That GitHub-scoped permission does **not** grant you a general license to reuse the contents outside GitHub or for any commercial purpose. ([GitHub Docs][3])

If this repository’s visibility changes later, existing forks and local copies may still exist. ([GitHub Docs][4])

## 5) Trademarks

“Birds Hill Burdock”, BHB, product names, logos, slogans, and trade dress are **trademarks** or claimed trademarks of BHB. Trademark registration (where applicable) provides exclusive rights across Canada for the registered goods/services. ([ISED][5])

Use of **™** (or **MC**) indicates a claim of trademark rights; **®** (or **MD**) is reserved for registered marks in Canada. ([Anchor IP Law][6])

You are not permitted to use BHB marks in a way that suggests affiliation, endorsement, origin, or sponsorship, or in any manner likely to confuse consumers.

## 6) Moral rights

Where applicable, BHB and/or the original creators **reserve moral rights**, including rights of attribution and integrity under Canadian law (moral rights cannot be assigned and may only be waived). ([Department of Justice Canada][7])

## 7) Permitted use

You may:

* View this repository and its contents on GitHub.
* Fork this repository on GitHub to the extent GitHub’s functionality permits.

You may also make uses that are **explicitly permitted by law**, including Canadian fair dealing where it applies. ([Department of Justice Canada][8])

## 8) Prohibited use (non-exhaustive)

Without express written permission from BHB, you may not:

* Copy or republish site text, product descriptions, blog posts, FAQs, or marketing copy.
* Copy, repost, or reuse product photography, graphics, icons, diagrams, or brand assets.
* Clone this website (or substantial portions) to another domain or storefront.
* Modify and redistribute the code/content as a derivative work outside GitHub-scoped viewing/forking.
* Use BHB trademarks, logos, or trade dress in product listings, ads, social accounts, domains, or packaging.
* Sell, license, or otherwise commercialize any repository materials.
* Use repository materials as training data or dataset content for machine learning systems, except where such use is unambiguously permitted by applicable law.

## 9) Enforcement posture

BHB actively monitors misuse of its intellectual property. Unauthorized use may trigger **immediate enforcement**, including:

* DMCA copyright takedown notices and escalations where applicable. ([GitHub Docs][9])
* Trademark policy violation reports for confusing or misleading brand use. ([GitHub Docs][10])
* Cease-and-desist demands, preservation letters, platform complaints, and civil claims seeking injunctions, damages, costs, and other remedies available under applicable law.

GitHub may publish DMCA takedown notices and counter-notices publicly (with limited redactions) as part of its transparency practice. ([GitHub][11])

## 10) Takedown pathways (platform-level)

If you host infringing copies on GitHub:

* Copyright: GitHub DMCA Takedown Policy process applies. ([GitHub Docs][9])
* Trademark: GitHub Trademark Policy process applies for confusing brand use. ([GitHub Docs][10])
* GitHub also reserves the right to remove content that violates laws or GitHub policies. ([GitHub Docs][3])

## 11) Third-party materials

Any third-party assets (fonts, libraries, icons, photos, frameworks) remain the property of their respective owners and are governed by their own licenses/notices. They are not covered by any permission from BHB.

## 12) Jurisdiction

This notice is governed by the laws applicable in Canada, without limiting any rights or remedies available in other jurisdictions for infringement occurring there.
